# What's this?
A continuation to my implementation of a minecraft like sandbox from [2D Minecraft](https://github.com/UnKnownnPasta/terminal-game-go-brr/blob/main/2d%20motion/2D-Minecraft.py)

## What i'm making here:
Making the game that runs in the terminal, run in a dedicated window; and perhaps even *more*
